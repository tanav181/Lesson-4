<main><section><article><h2>facts about the universe:</h2>
<p>The universe is everything that exists — all matter, energy, planets, stars, galaxies, and even space and time itself.
It began around 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a massive explosion that set everything in motion. Since then,
the universe has been expanding, and scientists believe it will continue to do so for billions of years.

Within this cosmic expanse are billions of galaxies, each containing countless stars and planets. Some of these worlds
might even harbor life. Despite centuries of study, we still understand only a fraction of the universe’s secrets — from
dark matter and dark energy to the ultimate fate of everything.

The universe is not just a scientific subject; it’s also a source of wonder, reminding us how small we are in the grand
cosmic scale. Yet, it’s within this vastness that humanity continues to explore, question, and dream.
