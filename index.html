<p>Dogs are one of the most popular pets in the world. Known for their loyalty and love, they make great companions for
people of all ages. Dogs come in many shapes and sizes, from tiny Chihuahuas to big Labradors.

They are smart animals that can learn tricks, follow commands, and even help people with disabilities. Dogs need proper
care, including food, exercise, and regular vet visits. In return, they give us friendship, protection, and lots of joy.

Whether you play with them or just cuddle, dogs always find a way to make you smile.</p></article></section>
